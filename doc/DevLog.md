# DevLog

## 01.01.2024

Created the git repository and wrote the first documentation of the project.
MIT LICENSE added


## 02.01.2024

Links in README added


## 03.01.2024

First map images drawn, these will later be used for the map generator.
First code written, this loads all images and displays them in random order. These images are also scaled to the window size.


## 04.01.2024

Added display maps using 2 dimensional arrays. These arrays can be infinitely large. 
For example: 1x1, 30x30, 100x100, ...
Starting with the map generator using Wave Function Collapse. This generator then delivers this 2 dimensional array. You will be able to adjust later how big the map should be and where the starting point is.


## 05.01.2024

Added entropy calculation. The entropy tells you how many different patterns can be at one point of the map. It is calculated, by checking all the 4 neighbor squares and check which pieces can fit. This is needed for the Wave Function Collapse.
Fixed a display bug, where the map was displayed mirrored.


## 06.01.2024

Added the first part of Wave Function Collapse.
Fixed bug in entropy calculation where entropy was calculated for a field that is not empty.


## 07.01.2024

Fixed a small display error where the images were not displayed correctly.
New map images created.
Wave Function Collapse now works almost perfectly, but still has a small error where it may be that not all fields are filled.


## 08.01.2024

Wave function collapse bugs fixed, but there is still a small bug where some fields don't get an image.


## 09.01.2024

I re-wrote the entire algorithm for the map generator because the old one was very slow and had a lot of errors. The new algorithm no longer uses recursion. The algorithm always looks for the next closest empty field and then assigns a random image to it. However, the algorithm has a small error, because an empty field is always output in the bottom right corner.


## 10.01.2024

Fixed the bug in the map generator, that created an empty field in the bottom right corner. 


## 11.01.2024

Created a new thread, that updates the display. With the new thread it is possible to separate the main game from the display in order to carry out calculations in the background.


## 12.01.2024

I added a communications object. The display thread and the main game therad communicate with each other via this communication object. For example, the current game status is stored in the object.


## 13.01.2024

The status is now stored in the Object and used. You can now change the status using a key. So far there are only 2 statuses.


## 14.01.2024

Added new keys to test the map generator.


## 15.01.2024

Cleaned my code and removed code that is no longer needed.
Added map cleaner. This cleans up the generated maps so that only the longest street is displayed.


## 16.01.2024

Created a player, which is a square right now. The player will be a car in the future. Added keys to control it


## 17.01.2024

Updated the ToDo List, added new points and marked what is already done.

## 31.01.2024

Completion of the bound generator, which now works for every map.


## 01.02.2024

Added a second player that can be controlled in the multiplayer mode.


## 02.02.2024

Started with the checkpoint generation. A Checkpoint is a line with the start and end point at the bounds. These checkpoints are created between 2 road map pieces. The checkpoints are needed, to know that a player drives in the right direction.


## 03.02.2024

Finished the checkpoint generation.


## 04.02.2024

Started with ray casting and displaying the rays.


## 05.02.2024

Finished ray casting.


## 06.02.2024

## 07.02.2024

Added a raceObject, which controls the race. Implemented a clock in the raceObject.


## 08.02.2024

## 12.03.2024

Fixed a bug in the map loader, where custom maps where loaded. Also fixed a bug where the values of the starting position had decimal places and therefore couldnÂ´t be stored in an int variable. Changed the variable to float in the whole programm.

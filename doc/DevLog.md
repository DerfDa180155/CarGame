First map images drawn, these will later be used for the map generator.
First code written, this loads all images and displays them in random order. These images are also scaled to the window size.


## 04.01.2024

Added display maps using 2 dimensional arrays. These arrays can be infinitely large. 
For example: 1x1, 30x30, 100x100, ...
Starting with the map generator using Wave Function Collapse. This generator then delivers this 2 dimensional array. You will be able to adjust later how big the map should be and where the starting point is.

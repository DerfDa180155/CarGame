# CarGame

This project is a racing game with a top down view. The programming language is python and the pygame library is used.
The maps are created with a self-made map generator. This is based on wave function collapse. There is also a mapmaker where you can create and save your own maps.
There are different settings for the races. For example, you can set how many players are driving, how many laps should be driven and much more.


The entire project will be adequately documented and explained. This documentation takes place in the [doc](./doc) folder.

You can find the working game in the [src](./src) folder. In the [sandbox](./sandbox) folder you will find the current version that I am currently working on, although errors may still occur that will still be fixed. Feel free to help me troubleshoot.

If you want to know whatâ€™s still missing, take a look at the [ToDo](./doc/ToDo.md) list.

You are welcome to ask me questions if something is unclear to you.
